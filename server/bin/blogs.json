  "main_content" : "Knock\u2026Knock\u2026Knock\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CROGAN! The bus is about to arrive, how long have you been in the shower!\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>Rogan gets startled by his mother\u2019s scream. His phone, which he had been holding for twenty minutes straight, almost flew off his fingertips. Fretting around to comprehend his surroundings, he realizes he has been sitting on the close-lid loo and hasn\u2019t showered yet. He stands up hurriedly and checks his watch in fright.\r<br/>\r<br/>9:27 A.M.\r<br/>\r<br/>What was I doing here for the past hour?! He stands muddled.\r<br/>Glancing at his phone, he reads,\r<br/>\r<br/>\u2018Lisa unmatched you\u2019\r<br/>\r<br/>Since the fall of the Roman empire, it had been the first instance that he was matched with someone on Tinder. And he screwed it up, all because he didn\u2019t reply on time.\r<br/>\r<br/>Why didn\u2019t I reply! What was I thinking! Am I\u2026\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CROGANNN!, QUICK!\u201D. His train of thought was broken yet again by his mum\u2019s screech and the next instant he found himself pulling the shower knob, almost instinctively!\r<br/>\r<br/>Rogan was a sophomore mathematics student at the Ontario Precision University. The peculiar quality that distinguished him was his ability, or rather his inability to communicate. A classic introvert, one might assume. However, he did enjoy the company and was rather inviting at the prospect of a social gathering. But when it came down to actually talking, no words reached his tongue.\r<br/>\r<br/>Back in Rogan's class, the professor asked them to choose their elective activity for the semester. They had the option to elect applied calculus or linear algebra. A form was circulated for students to make a choice and submit within the next five minutes. Meanwhile, Rogan seemed oblivious to his surroundings. Just like how a sophomore Math major would look at a multivariable calculus paper, Rogan was staring into blank space without an accompanying thought. \r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CMr. Rogan, sadly enough, we don\u2019t have all day. Tell me which list shall I put you under? Calculus is it?\u201D the professor asked in a mundane tone.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CUmm\u2026I elect..uh\u2026Linear calculus\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CHuh? Linear what?\u201D the professor mocked.\r<br/>\r<br/>Meanwhile, he heard a familiar voice that reminded him of an old scar at the back of his head from the locker room\u2019s gear.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CDude, stop wasting our time. I got my practice in five minutes!\u201D - A guy was heard from the back of the class.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CI have a class in fifteen minutes as well so Mr. Rogan I am putting you under calculus. Ms. Su-che would be glad to have you.\u201D the professor uttered with apparent sarcasm.\r<br/> \r<br/>\u201CClass dismissed. Remember you have your finals on the last Friday of this month and the grading will be on a curve...\u201D - the professor continued in a class of emptying students. \r<br/>\r<br/>It took Rogan a good seven minutes to fathom what had actually happened. The ground beneath felt wobbly to the point where he could swear it was an earthquake. He felt as if he had been punched in the gut and the air rushed out of his lungs. He was just about ready to throw in the towel, to call it a day, to give up. \r<br/>\r<br/>Back home, the thoughts of the final test took over Rogan\u2019s mind. He felt the need to prove his mettle. Especially to that bully Andrew who was getting late to his practice. Mastering Integral Calculus wasn\u2019t a breeze and Rogan knew that. Notwithstanding, Rogan gave it his all. He dotted all i\u2019s and crossed all t\u2019s.\r<br/>\r<br/>The examination was conducted and to everyone\u2019s surprise, including Rogan himself, he aced the test and topped his class. However, he knew that it hadn\u2019t come easy. A fortnight\u2019s worth of grind was behind it. But just as he finished analyzing his answer sheet, he noticed some bustle at the teacher\u2019s desk. Andrew and a couple of other students were mumbling something to the professor while looking at him. Before he could react to the situation he heard the professor calling out his name.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CRogan, please come here with your answer sheet\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>At first, he couldn\u2019t move. He stood frozen, staring at the professor\u2019s desk in oblivion, almost lost of his vision. His trembling fingers mustered a loose contact with the answer sheet as he heard his name echo again.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CRogan, be quick!\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>At the desk, the professor, while skimming through Rogan\u2019s response booklet halted at a page and asked,\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CExplain me the procedure as to how you solved the integral of arctan x\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>Why am I being interrogated like this? Does he think I cheated on the test? Andrew seems to be behind all this\u2026\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CRogan, did you hear me?\u201D, the professor repeated in a staunch tone.\r<br/>\r<br/>Integration by parts using some theorem, but what was it called? Agh, I can\u2019t recollect its name. How about I explain the substitution method instead? But I haven\u2019t used that in the paper, so wouldn\u2019t it doubt the integrity of my solution? Agh, what do I do!\r<br/>\r<br/>His brain was tossed up into dizziness. He knew the gravity of the situation and wanted to speak. But, as if someone had pulled the plug between his prefrontal cortex and his hippocampus, he was lost of his senses! \r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CAh\u2026I used integration by parts\u2026maybe\u2026.oh no wait. I actually used integration by substitution here I guess and\u2026\u201D, Rogan mumbled.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CWait wait. Let me stop you there. You are making no sense at all, child. I asked what symptoms have you been experiencing which led you to assume you are suffering from brain fog?\u201D, the doctor interrupted Rogan.\r<br/> \r<br/>\u201CToo many dates with Mary Jane it seems.\u201D, the doctor continued with a wry smile over his face.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CUh\u2026sorry, could you repeat what you just asked, doctor?\u201D"
