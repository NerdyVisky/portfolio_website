  "main_content" : "Jeloitte\u2026 8.5 \r<br/>Rel Chemicals\u2026 8  \r<br/>OTPC\u2026 8\r<br/>Mondal Steel\u2026 7.5\r<br/>\r<br/>With each row, Kshitij\u2019s heart sunk a little as he checked the CG cutoffs for the arriving companies in the upcoming placement season. To crack a placement while being from a core engineering background was never an easy task. And a seven-point-two cumulative grade point made it even worse. In frustration, he rapidly paginated the information portal and was just about to close the tab when a desirably low cut-off CGPA caught his eye. \r<br/>\r<br/>HTL technologies - Minimum Grade requirement: 7.0.\r<br/>Open to all branches with no backlog criteria.  \r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CFinally, something to cheer about\u201D, he muttered as he fetched a small piece of paper lying over his desk. While noting down the freshly gathered information about the new company, he subconsciously glanced over the pre-written text on the paper.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tessar - 18th August\r<br/>Infoco - 23rd August\r<br/>\r<br/>The wave of nascent relief was quickly replaced by an intense emotion of post-traumatic stress as he was recalled of his past interview experiences. \r<br/>\u201CInfoco was a disaster, I shouldn\u2019t have much hope of hearing back from them\u201D, he thought. Moreover, he is reminded of each of the questions he was asked in the interview, and just for a change, thinks of how he could have answered them honestly - raw and blunt.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Tell me about yourself. \r<br/>\u201CThe second line of the page you\u2019re holding right now bears my name. And before you mispronounce it, the \u2018K\u2019 in my name is silent. Anyway, I am Ksithij from Mechanical. Something about me \u2013  even after four years of mechanical engineering I still don\u2019t know \u2018how an induction motor starts\u2019. And yes, I play Valo. A lot.\u201D      \r<br/>\r<br/>- Tell me about your strengths and weaknesses.\r<br/>\u201DAs for strengths, I can survive on two hours of sleep and partially-cooked Maggi. I am an expert at concealing my shower routines and I am proud of passing my ED end-semester when I mistakenly prepared for engineering chemistry instead. Now, I don\u2019t get the point why I would disclose my weaknesses to you in a fifteen-minute interview, but anyway, as you might have already guessed, I am not a social person. If I were, I would have had a better CG for my online semesters.\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>- Why should we hire you for this role?\r<br/>\u201CBecause I need a job? I mean, what\u2019s the point of pursuing my bachelor's from an NIT if I don\u2019t get a job. And honestly, I can\u2019t imagine myself working at my dad\u2019s saree shop. Holding a saree with my arms outstretched in front of those vexing aunties? NEVER. The sheer idea of it haunts me.\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>- Where do you see yourself in five years?\r<br/>\u201CAt a better company than yours. Definitely.\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>Kshitij starts to grin while mumbling these alternate savage replies. I should rather apply to AIB as a scriptwriter, he jests. Meanwhile, his train of thought breaks as his phone starts to ring. Throughout his time in college, Kshitij never felt anxious while answering a call from his mom. But today was different. Today, he couldn\u2019t gather enough courage to take the call. He stared at his phone in despondency and watched it silence itself after a while. The thirty-odd seconds of the phone ring felt like a lifetime and within that period, Kshitij felt he had had enough. By hook or crook, he needed to get through the HTL shortlisting round and keeping all his ego aside, ace the interview.   \r<br/>\r<br/>The following day, Kshitij was heading downstairs for lunch. Figurative of its surroundings, his mind also found itself in a mess. He couldn\u2019t resist but think of the HTL first shortlisting round the following week. Short on confidence, he was desperately looking for some piece of advice from anyone with a \u2018placed\u2019 tag attached to them. All of a sudden, he couldn\u2019t identify people by their names. All he saw was individuals holding plates in their hands with bubbles popping on top of their heads bearing the companies they were placed in and their CTCs. \r<br/>\r<br/>Just then Kshitij spots Antim, and he is delighted. He is assured that Antim hasn\u2019t been placed yet, considering his track record of poor CG and the three backlogs he cleared just the previous semester. Kshitij waves at him, inviting him over to his table in hopes of an empathetic conversation.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201COyeee\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CYo bro, why so late today?\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CNothing man, just filled the HTL form before I came. You must have filled it as well, right? The deadline is EOD. Don\u2019t forge-t\u2026.\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201COh dude, wait, didn\u2019t I tell you before? I just got placed last week in Tessar with 10 CTC. Thank god! I am done with grinding DSA for hours. Never opening GLG and Geetcode again. Now I am thinking-\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CWhaaa..you got placed? How\u2026I mean, congratulations!\u201D Kshitij interrupted Antim as he couldn\u2019t fathom what he had just heard. \r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CYeah, the final interviews were last week. Luckily my interviewer was in a light mood and didn\u2019t grill me much. And you kno-w wh-....\u201D\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CSo lucky yaar.\u201D Kshitij downheartedly patted Antim on the back, cutting Antim short again and he stood up from the table to leave for his room.\r<br/>\r<br/>While he was waiting for the elevator, an email notification popped on his phone. Seeing that it was from the T&P section, he opened it instinctively. The very first line read \u2013 Due to unavoidable circumstances, HTL had decided to cancel its placement drive in SVNIT. As this company was his final prospect, he slowly starts to visualize himself folding sarees. But just as this horrifying thought crosses his mind, he snaps back to reality and starts skimming through his emails for any kind of lead. On one last hopeless scroll, a familiar word flashes for a split second, thereby prompting him to scroll back up. He finds an unread email from Infoco sent the previous day. On reading its content, his soul momentarily leaves his body as he couldn\u2019t believe what his eyes read.\r<br/>\r<br/>\u201CCongratulations! You\u2019ve been selected. Please select your preferred location.\u201D\r"
